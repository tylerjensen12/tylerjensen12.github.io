      <h2>About Me!</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Tyler Jensen and I am a Software Developer. I have
        built a couple full stack web apps using the PERN stack.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Tyler, and I'm a software
        engineer/developer. Along with development I enjoy spending my free time
        paddleboarding with my wife, learning new tricks on the trampoline, or
        going out for a ride on my electric unicycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        My development focus has been on frontend engineering using React.js to
        create reusable dynamic components for the best user experience
        possible. With a keen eye for small details, I love making sure the
        concepts and wireframes will work efficiently once in production. I have
        a passion for web accessibility and providing the best possible
        experience and use for all.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a life long learner I have gathered skills in development/engineering
        and many complementary skills. Some of these include the Spanish
        language, coaching, music, graphic design, video, social media content
        and strategy.
